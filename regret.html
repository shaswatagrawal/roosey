        <h1>The Heart You Broke</h1>
        <h2>YOU WERE THE REASON TO QUIT AND YOU ARE THE REASON TO START IT AGAIN (REMEMBER IT)</h2>
        <p>I remember the nights we spent laughing until dawn, the way your eyes lit up when I held you close. Those moments were real, weren't they? But now, they're just echoes in the silence you left behind.</p>
        <p>You broke my heart into pieces when you walked away, shattering the trust and love I poured into us. You chose to leave, thinking the grass was greener elsewhere. Maybe it is, for a while. But I've realized my worthâ€”the love I gave freely, the support I offered without question, the future we could have built together.</p>
        <p>As I rise from this pain, stronger and wiser, picking up the fragments of my broken heart, I wonder if you'll ever look back and see what you truly lost. A man who would have moved mountains for you, who saw your flaws and loved you more for them.</p>
        <p>This isn't revenge; it's goodbye. I'll thrive without you, rebuilding from the pieces you left behind, but deep down, I hope you find peace... even if it means regretting letting me go.</p>
        <p class="farewell">Forever in my memories, but no longer in my heart.</p>
